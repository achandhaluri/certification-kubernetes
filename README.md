Important Note about CNI and CKA Exam
An important tip about deploying Network Addons in a Kubernetes cluster.



In the upcoming labs, we will work with Network Addons. This includes installing a network plugin in the cluster. While we have used weave-net as an example, please bear in mind that you can use any of the plugins which are described here:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#how-to-implement-the-kubernetes-networking-model



In the CKA exam, for a question that requires you to deploy a network addon, unless specifically directed, you may use any of the solutions described in the link above.



However, the documentation currently does not contain a direct reference to the exact command to be used to deploy a third party network addon.

The links above redirect to third party/ vendor sites or GitHub repositories which cannot be used in the exam. This has been intentionally done to keep the content in the Kubernetes documentation vendor-neutral.

At this moment in time, there is still one place within the documentation where you can find the exact command to deploy weave network addon:



https://v1-22.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/#steps-for-the-first-control-plane-node (step 2)

Declarative and imparative 
---------------------------
Certification Tips - Imperative Commands with Kubectl
While you would be working mostly the declarative way - using definition files, imperative commands can help in getting one time tasks done quickly, as well as generate a definition template easily. This would help save considerable amount of time during your exams.

Before we begin, familiarize with the two options that can come in handy while working with the below commands:

--dry-run: By default as soon as the command is run, the resource will be created. If you simply want to test your command , use the --dry-run=client option. This will not create the resource, instead, tell you whether the resource can be created and if your command is right.

-o yaml: This will output the resource definition in YAML format on screen.



Use the above two in combination to generate a resource definition file quickly, that you can then modify and create resources as required, instead of creating the files from scratch.



#POD
Create an NGINX Pod

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx



Generate POD Manifest YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run)

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml



Deployment
Create a deployment

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx



Generate Deployment YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run)

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml



Generate Deployment with 4 Replicas

kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --replicas=4



You can also scale a deployment using the kubectl scale command.

kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=4

Another way to do this is to save the YAML definition to a file and modify

kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml



You can then update the YAML file with the replicas or any other field before creating the deployment.



Service
Create a Service named redis-service of type ClusterIP to expose pod redis on port 6379

kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service --dry-run=client -o yaml

(This will automatically use the pod's labels as selectors)

Or

kubectl create service clusterip redis --tcp=6379:6379 --dry-run=client -o yaml (This will not use the pods labels as selectors, instead it will assume selectors as app=redis. You cannot pass in selectors as an option. So it does not work very well if your pod has a different label set. So generate the file and modify the selectors before creating the service)



Create a Service named nginx of type NodePort to expose pod nginx's port 80 on port 30080 on the nodes:

kubectl expose pod nginx --type=NodePort --port=80 --name=nginx-service --dry-run=client -o yaml

(This will automatically use the pod's labels as selectors, but you cannot specify the node port. You have to generate a definition file and then add the node port in manually before creating the service with the pod.)

Or

kubectl create service nodeport nginx --tcp=80:80 --node-port=30080 --dry-run=client -o yaml

(This will not use the pods labels as selectors)

Both the above commands have their own challenges. While one of it cannot accept a selector the other cannot accept a node port. I would recommend going with the kubectl expose command. If you need to specify a node port, generate a definition file using the same command and manually input the nodeport before creating the service.
