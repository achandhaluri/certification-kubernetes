1) Registering the Node
2) Create PODs
3) Monitering the POD and Node


Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture

we will look at kubelet.

Earlier we discussed that the kubelet is like the captain on the ship. They lead all activities on

a ship.

They're the ones responsible for doing all the paperwork necessary to become part of the cluster,

They're the sole point of contact from the master ship.

They load or unload containers on the ship as instructed by the scheduler on the master.

They also send back reports at regular intervals on the status of the ship and the containers on them.

The kubelet in the kubernetes worker node, registers the node with the kubernetes cluster.

When it receives instructions to load a container or a POD on the node, it requests the container run time

engine, which may be Docker, to pull the required image and run an instance.

The kubelet then continues to monitor the state of the POD and the containers in it and reports to the kube-api

server on a timely basis.

So how do you install the kubelet? If you use kubeadm tool to deploy your cluster, it does not

automatically deploy the kubelet.

Now that's the difference from the other components.

You must always manually install the kubelet on your worker nodes. Download the installer, extract

it and run it as a service.

You can view the running kubelet process and the effective options by listing the process on the worker

node and searching for kubelet.

We will look more into kubelets, how to configure kubelets, generate certificates, and finally how

to TLS bootstrap kubelets later in this course.

That's it for now.

Will see you in the next lecture.
